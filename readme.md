## Curricula

- [Intro_to_STEMBot](https://github.com/BotDevLLC/BotDevCurriculum/blob/master/Curriculum/Week_1/readme.md)
    - The purpose of module one is to get the student familiar with STEMBot and its operation.  Module one focuses on producing small victories for students and building their confidence and enthusiasm to pursue STEM and Robotics skills. 
- [STEMBot_Anatomy](https://github.com/BotDevLLC/BotDevCurriculum/blob/master/Curriculum/Week_2/readme.md)
    - The focus of module two is to get students ready to build their own robots.  Students learn the art of robot design and construction by understanding STEMBot, its components, and assembly.  
- [STEMBot Programming](https://github.com/BotDevLLC/BotDevCurriculum/blob/master/Curriculum/Week_3/readme.md)
    - Module three focuses on getting students comfortable programming the STEMBot.  Programming is broken down into its main components and students complete a series of challenges to gain a deeper understanding of coding. 
- [Advanced_Electrical_Engineering](https://github.com/BotDevLLC/BotDevCurriculum/blob/master/Curriculum/Week_4/readme.md)
    - If you are going to design and build robots, youâ€™ll need to know how to supply motors, actuators, sensors, and microcontrollers with electrical power to exacting specifications.  If your robot is going to have any degree of autonomy, it will need to use sensors to detect and model its environment.  The focus of this module is to familiarize the students with the design and construction of power systems, operation of sensors and motors, and addressing and signal protocols of General Purpose Input/Output Pins(GPIO) on a microcontroller.

    - This module is full of supplemental materials. There are many related subject that dovetail with the subjects taught in this curriculum. Supplemental materials provide the teacher additional periods of instruction to help them meet their schedule needs and students' pace of learning and hunger for knowledge.
