# INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES 
 A.	Anticipatory Set: Draw student’s attention by telling them they are going learn how people worked on computers in the early age by only using a monitor and a keyboard
 
 # B.	Body: 
# 1.	What is a terminal?

Terminal is program which provides a text-based interface for a user to navigate through the computer. Windows operating system uses the name “Command Prompt” for it and other operating systems call it as “Terminal”. 

# 2.	UNIX Commands

UNIX commands are the syntaxes are used in the terminal for the user to navigate through the program. It allows the users to make directories, files and even write codes on which is known as shell scripting. 

## **Note: UNIX is case sensitive**
### i.	ls
ls allows the users to list all the files in a directory (folder).

### ii.	ls –l
Ls –l lists all the files in a directory in a long format. Long format shows all the detailed information of the files such as the ownership of the files, who can view and edit the file and the exact file size.
