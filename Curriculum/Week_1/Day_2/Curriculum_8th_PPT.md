# INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES 
What is the step-by-step plan for the teaching of this lesson?

A.	Anticipatory Set: “What is a robot?”
a.	Begin the lecture by displaying the STEMBot and allow students to come up and observe the STEMBot as well as the different components to them. 

B.	Body:  Allow students to explore the robot you just modeled for them.
a.	Students will reflect on what they saw and start to think about how it was designed and built.
b.	Ask students “What do you think the design process for any time of system or robot?” Allow for students to respond without giving the answer. 
c.	Tell students to write their answers on a piece of paper. Next, move forward and start with the presentation. 
d.	As the presentation concludes, ask them to compare their initial answers with notes from the lecture. 
e.	At the end of the presentation, ask the students to design their own robot using the criteria in the PowerPoint:
i.	Defining the problem
ii.	Research and design
iii.	Creating a prototype
iv.	Building the robot
v.	Programming and testing the robot
vi.	Evaluating the robot 

C. 	Closure: Present robot designs and describe the process to recap.
