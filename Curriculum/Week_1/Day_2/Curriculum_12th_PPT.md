# INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES 
What is the step-by-step plan for the teaching of this lesson?

A.	Anticipatory Set: “What is a multi-disciplinary team?”
a.	Begin the lecture by displaying the STEMBot and allow students to come up and observe the STEMBot as well as the different components to them. 

B.	Body:  Allow students to explore the robot you just modeled for them.
a.	Tell the students to pay attention to the different components of the robot.
b.	Ask students “What major(s) do you think worked on building the STEMBot?” Allow for students to respond and explain why they think each major they thought of was involved.
c.	Next, explain that business, computer science, information systems, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering students were involved. 
d.	Present with PowerPoint. 
e.	Ask students to get in groups and discuss what majors/trades they plan on going into post-graduation and discuss how each job can complement each other
