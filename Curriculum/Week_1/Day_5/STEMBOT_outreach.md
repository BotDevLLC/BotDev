# VITAL INFORMATION
Subject(s):  Robotics

Topic or Unit: Introduction to robotics

Grade/Level: Middle School & High School

Time Allotment: 1-2 hours

Standards:   

Middle School:

3.4.5.A3. Describe how technologies are often combined.

3.4.6.A3. Explain how knowledge from other fields of study (STEM) integrate to create new technologies. 

3.4.4.C1. Understand that there is no perfect design.

3.4.3.C2. Explain why the design process requires creativity and consideration of all ideas.

3.4.6.D2. Use computers appropriately to access and organize and apply information

Physics

3.2.4.B1. Explain how an object’s change in motion can be observed and measured

3.2.6.B1. Explain how changes in motion requires a force. 

High School:

3.4.10.A3. Examine how technology transfer occurs when new user applies an existing innovation developed for one purpose in a different function.

3.4.10.C2. Analyze a prototype to test a design concept by making actual observations and necessary adjustments.

3.4.10.C3. Illustrate the concept that not all problems are technological and not every problem can be solved using technology.

Unit Goal(s):  
By the end of this workshop, students should understand how knowledge from different engineering fields can be used to develop a robot and learn how to make the robot function. 

Objective(s): 
Write functions (commands with values) to make the robot move along the track.   
Assessment(s):   
 
 In form of groups, students should be able to write program in Scratch, measure accurately and make the robot function

# INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES

A.	Anticipatory Set: Draw student’s attention by relating real world objects to robots

B.	Body:  
1.	Ask students to give examples of robots. Talk about what robotics and a robot is. Then, give examples of how robots are used in real world. 
2.	Introduce STEMBot as a robot that the students will program today. Describe how the STEMBot can work and show the students how to log in to the raspberry pi and program the robot. 
3.	Divide students into teams. Introduce the activity that students will have to program the robot to go along the track. Describe how they can achieve this by working together in teams, measuring track lengths and writing the appropriate functions in scratch. Ensure that all students understand the process to program STEMBot.
4.	In the end, congratulate all students for participating and reiterate how important it is to work in teams to make projects successful. 

C.	Closure: 

Students will make the STEMBot move along a given track in the allocated time by programming in Scratch. They will move the robot to a specific distance, in different directions and angles according to the what they analyze and measure.
