# VITAL INFORMATION

Subject(s): Robotics	 

Topic or Unit: Test One- Solo Flight Navigating a novel Maze	

Grade/Level: 	8th Grade

Time Allotment:	 30 minutes

Standards:          

3.4.7.D2. Select and safely use appropriate tools, products and systems for specific tasks.  

3.4.8.D2. Operate and maintain systems in order to achieve a given purpose.  

3.4.6. D2. Use computers appropriately to access and organize and apply information

15.4.12.H. Use programming languages to develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Unit Goal(s):     Students will demonstrate and apply what they have learned in week 1.

Objective(s):      Students should operate the STEMBot and navigate through the maze either in teams or on their own. 

Assessment(s):  
1. Connect to the STEMBot
2. Study and measure the environment and path through the maze
3. Find and alter the necessary program to define STEMBot’s path
4. Run the program
5. Observe the STEMBot’s behavior and repeat steps 3-5 until the STEMBot completes the maze as required

# INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES

Now that students have a good understanding of how to operate the STEMBot and adjust its behavior in the real world, it’s time for students to take their first solo flight.

1.	Use masking tape to create a maze on the floor with a starting box and a destination box. Ensure to make several 90 degree turns.

2.	Divide the students in teams (if necessary)

3.	Provide the student with all the necessary resources such as the STEMBot, Computer and tape. Students will need to make the STEMBot travel through the maze ending in the destination box in the allocated time.

Closure: Students will be assessed on how well they can perform all the activities listed    in “Assessment”. 



# MATERIALS AND RESOURCES

* STEMBot(s)
