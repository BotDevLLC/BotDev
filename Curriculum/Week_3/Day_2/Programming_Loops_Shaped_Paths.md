# VITAL INFORMATION
Subject(s):          Programming	 

Topic or Unit:     Programming - Loops

Grade/Level:       8th – 12th Grade

Time Allotment:	 30 minutes

Standards:        

  15.4.8.I. Solve a problem with an algorithm.

   15.4.12.H. Use programming languages to develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Unit Goal(s):      By the end of the unit, students will use an algorithm to make the STEMBot move and complete a square     path. Students will also have an understanding of geometry. 

Objective(s):       Students should measure the path between four boxes, each box being the corner of a square and be able to program the STEMBot to move between those four boxes, completing the square path. Students should also measure the distance and degree of angles to make the robot form a right angle and equilateral triangle 

# INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES 

1.	Go through the Loops PowerPoint (15 min) 
- <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16Djq43JydV66X6vxOkaF4u3-K6mG90Os" target="_blank">Loops PowerPoint</a>

# Note: There are additional Notes on the PowerPoint that will be useful for the Presentation  

2.	Review Progress Check questions at the end of the PowerPoint 

3.	Students need to have access to STEMBot and need to open “LoopsExercise.py” program in Thonny IDE. 

4.	Provide the student with tape measures or yard sticks.  Students will measure the path and write function calls in python program to make the STEMBot travel from box to box. We will use loops in the paths on square and triangle for it to repeat.   (See Slide _ for details)

# MATERIALS AND RESOURCES
* STEMBot(s) 
* Computer(s)
