# VITAL INFORMATION
Subject(s):          Programming	 

Topic or Unit:     Programming - Variables	

Grade/Level:       8th – 12th Grade

Time Allotment:	 30 minutes

Standards:          15.4.8.H. Explain the differences between a scripting language and a coding language. 

15.4.12.H. Use programming languages to develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Unit Goal(s):      By the end of the unit, students will have an understanding of what variables are as well as how they play a part in programming.

Objective(s):      Students should make the STEMBot reach its destination by assigning correct values to variables.

# INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES 
  1.	Go through the Variables PowerPoint (15 min) 
  - <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10ihzOKchmn2pLq6i7ZeUHs4Oh0055CV5" target="_blank">Variables      PowerPoint</a>

# Note: There are additional Notes on the PowerPoint that will be useful for the Presentation  

2.	Review Progress Check questions at the end of the PowerPoint 

3.	Students need to have access to STEMBot and need to open “VariableExercise.py” program in Thonny IDE. 

4.	Flip in front of the STEMBot and tell students to make STEMBot land on top of the coin. Provide the student with tape measures or yard sticks. Students will measure the path and assign values to variables in python program to make the STEMBot reach the destination in 3 steps. (See Slide 11 for details)
