# Q1. How does the code for the conditional statements get broken? 

Hint 1: There is more than just one way for the loop to break in this program. 

Hint 2: Look for the different conditional statements within the program, such as if and nested if statements
A1: if(x%200==0):
if(smartStop(triggerLeft, echoLeft, "Left") or smartStop(triggerRight, echoRight, "Right") or smartStop(triggerCenter, echoCenter, "Center"))

A2:  if(x%45==0):
if(smartStop(triggerLeft, echoLeft, "Left") or smartStop(triggerRight, echoRight,     "Right") or smartStop(triggerCenter, echoCenter, "Center")):
 

# Q2. Why does the STEMBot have the conditional statements in the program?

Hint 1: Think back to the PowerPoint
A: Without conditional statements in our program, many lines of the same code to perform the smartStop action and it would be required and we would not be able to control the flow of a program.
