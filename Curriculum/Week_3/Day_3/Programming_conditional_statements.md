# VITAL INFORMATION

Subject(s):          Programming	 

Topic or Unit:     Programming - Conditional Statements

Grade/Level:       8th – 12th Grade

Time Allotment:	 30 minutes

Standards:        

15.4.12.H. Use programming languages to develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills.


Unit Goal(s):      By the end of the unit, students will be able to define conditional statements and discuss the types of conditional statements

Objective(s):      Students will understand conditional statements and how they work withing programs.


# INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	Go through the Conditional Statements PowerPoint (15 min) 

2.	Review Progress questions in the worksheet, with solutions attached.  

3.	Students need to have access to STEMBot and need to open “Sync_Sensors.py” program in Thonny IDE. 

4.	Provide the student with tape measures or yard sticks.  Students will measure the path and write function calls in python program to make the STEMBot travel from box to box. We will use conditional statements in the program to see if the code breaks or not based on how it is programmed to move.
