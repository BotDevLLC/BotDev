# Mini Lesson (20 minutes)
1.	Describe what CAD is 
2.	Describe why CAD is important 
3.	Real Life Applications of CAD

# 1.	What is Computer Aided Design? 
-	Computer Aided Design (CAD) is the use of Computer software or technology to create, modify, analyze, and optimize a design.   (Define bolded words if necessary)
-	CAD can create detailed diagrams with information that is used in the manufacturing of the design.
-	The detailed diagrams may be in 2D or 3D form and contain information such as dimensions, materials, tolerances, and processes.
-	There are many different types of CAD that may be used depending on task you want completed

# 2.	Why is CAD important?
-	Designing with CAD is much quicker and more flexible than designing by hand, allowing for engineers to make small and intricate changes to increase the quality of the part
-	Digital copies of the design may be sent to others for more collaboration, maximizing productivity
-	CAD drawings are a uniform way to relay useful information (such as materials, tolerances, dimensions, and processes) to manufacturers or other engineers
-	CAD drawings are often 3D printed to show real life scaling and details to a team or customer

# 3.	Real Life Applications of CAD

# 4.	Assessment
For each bullet below have a class discussion on the following questions to gauge retention from students
•	How would you describe CAD to someone?
•	Why is CAD more worthwhile than hand drawings and designs?
•	What other applications can you see CAD being used other than the ones mentioned above?
•	What other things did you learn about CAD today that you did not already know?
•	After learning this information about CAD who is interested in learning how to use CAD software to create designs
