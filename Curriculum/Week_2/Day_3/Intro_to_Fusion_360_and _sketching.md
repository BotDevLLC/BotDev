15.	If you want to pin the shortcut to your taskbar (if using windows) you can right click the icon and click “pin to taskbar”


# Body: 
a.	Follow this tutorial with the students to sketch and extrude a chair 

1.	Start by saving your file. Each file you make is stored in a project folder you select or create, to keep it organized.  I named my file “Introduction” and saved it under a new project I created called “Curriculum”.
  <img src=https://github.com/BotDevLLC/BotDevCurriculum/blob/master/Pictures/pic%2046.png>

2.	There are numerous ways to make your 3D design or assembly, but we will start by creating a new component.  Click the dropdown arrow Assemble and then click New Component
  <img src=https://github.com/BotDevLLC/BotDevCurriculum/blob/master/Pictures/pic%2047.png>

3.	The New Component Dialog Box will appear. Make sure Empty Component is selected because we do not have any saved files. You can Name your component as you see fit. For teaching purposes, we will be making a chair in this tutorial so I will call my component “Chair”. Select Okay.

Note: On the left side of your screen is your Browser which is the tree structure view of all your components. In the future you can create numerous components in one file to assemble, which will be organized here. The circle next to chair shows that the component is active. Origin is referring to the plane you are working on.

4.	Press the letter “L” on your keyboard, and it will reveal the 3 origin planes to choose from to draw your first sketch. The three origin planes shown correspond to the View Cube shown in the top right corner.
- Clicking on a side of the View Cube will give you the view of that plane on the model
- Clicking and dragging the View Cube will let you spin the model to see all
    <img src=https://github.com/BotDevLLC/BotDevCurriculum/blob/master/Pictures/pic%2050.png>
                                                                                                     


5.	Select the front of the view cube, choosing the x-y plane as your origin plane.

6.	We can now begin to draw our sketch for our design. The blue colored icons above the CREATE icon are what we will be using to draw the shapes of our sketch.

7.	Start by hitting the line button and clicking once in the center of the grid. Move your mouse to the right and you will see a distance dialog box. Here you can type in the distance you want 
- Type the distance you want (I choose 50mm)
- Moving the mouse up or down will open a second dialog box where you can set the angle you would like
- Hitting the tab button will let you switch back and forth from length and angle dialog boxes so you can change each measurement
- Pressing enter will lock in the line
  <img src=https://github.com/BotDevLLC/BotDevCurriculum/blob/master/Pictures/pic%2053.png>

8.	To remove a line or shape click the trim button shown as the scissor icon above the modify banner and click the part you would like to remove. Because this angled line will not be a part of the completed sketch, I removed it here.
  <img src=https://github.com/BotDevLLC/BotDevCurriculum/blob/master/Pictures/pic%2054.png>



- Note that the trim button will remove excess parts of a sketch that is not connected to other lines or shapes. For Example, If the shape below appeared and you clicked to “trim” the boxed part, clicking that area would only remove that small portion, not the entire line.

to check the dimensions of a line click the dimension button and click on the line you wish to measure.

9.	For today, we are going to be making a simple chair.  We will start with making the base of our chair which will look like a box.
- Autodesk will turn 2D sketches into 3D models which we will see in step 10.
- For the sketch to be successful it must be a closed shape. To check if you shape is fully closed it will be filled with a light blue color.

10.	In your sketch make a square starting from the origin

11.	 Click on finish sketch in the top right corner.
12.	Click “Extrude”
13.	Extrude the box 10mm by adding in the dimension I the dialog box on the right-hand side.
14.	Click the bottom face of the box, and click sketch.
15.	 Draw four circles, click finish sketch.
16.	Click extrude, and extrude sketch 50mm.
17.	To draw the back rest of the chair click on the top of the chair base and click sketch.
18.	Draw a rectangle lining up with each side shown below and finish sketch.
19.	Extrude Sketch 50mm.
