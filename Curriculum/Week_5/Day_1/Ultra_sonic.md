# VITAL INFORMATION

Subject(s):          Ultrasonic Sensor 

Topic or Unit:     Programing & Physics - Ultrasonic Sensor

Grade/Level:       8th – 12th Grade

Time Allotment:	 30 minutes

Standards:         

3.4.6.A3. Explain how knowledge from other fields of study (STEM) integrate to create new technologies.  

15.4.12.H. Use programming languages to develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

3.2.4.B1. Explain how an object’s change in motion can be observed and measured  

3.4.8.D3. Interpret and evaluate the accuracy of the information obtained and determine its usefulness. 

Unit Goal(s):      By the end of the unit, students will have an understanding of what ultrasonic sensors are as well as how they play a part in robotics.

Objective(s):      Students should be able to do simple distance calculation and understand how ultrasonic sensor program works. 

# INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	Go through the UltrasonicSensor PowerPoint (15 min) 

<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10wZY2EHtWWunkD425uKqsq4-I2B7r83B" target="_blank">Ultrasonic Sensor PowerPoint</a>

Note: There are additional Notes on the PowerPoint that will be useful for the Presentation  

2.	Review Progress Check questions at the end of the PowerPoint 
3.	Students need to complete the provided worksheet either in class or at home as an assignment. 

4.	Students need to have access to STEMBot and need to open the “SmartStop.py” program in Thonny IDE. 

5.	Place an obstacle in front of the STEMBot and observe if the STEMBot stops at the given distance from the obstacle.
