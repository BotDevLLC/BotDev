**Q1.  If the object is 300 cm away from the ultrasonic sensor, how long in seconds does the sound wave need to travel?**

Step 1: 

 We know that the speed of sound = 340 m/s. Since the object distance is given in cm, we either need to convert the distance in meters or speed of sound in centimeters. 

1 meter = 100 cm 

1 cm = 1/100 m 
300 cm = 300/100 m = 3m


Step 2: 
Given, 
Distance = 2 * 3m = 6m
Speed = 340 m/s
Time = ?

Plug in the values to the speed equation and find time. Remember, the sound wave needs to travel forward and bounce backward.

The formula for Speed = DistanceTime

340m/s = DistanceTime

340m/s = 6Time

Multiplying both sides by Time we get, 

Time * 340 = 6Time* Time

Time * 340 = 6

Dividing both sides by 340 we get, 

Time * 340 340 = 6340

Time = 6340sec = 0.018 sec


**Q2.  If it takes 2 second for the sound wave to travel forward and bounce back, how far is the object from the ultrasonic sensor? Can the ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** we discussed in class measure this distance?

Given, 
	Time = 2 s
We know that, 
	Speed = 340 m/s and Distance = 2 * Distance
The formula for Speed = DistanceTime
		
Plugging in the know values in the equation we have, 

		340 = 2 * Distance2  s

		Multiply both sides by 2
		
	340 * 2 = 2 * Distance2 s * 2

	340 * 2 = 2 * Distance

	Dividing both sides by 2, 

	(340 * 2) 2  = Distance

Therefore, Distance = 340 m 

No, HC-SR04 can only measure distance up to 5 meters.
