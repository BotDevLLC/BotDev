# Worksheet

**Q1. If the object is 300 cm away from the ultrasonic sensor, how long in seconds does the sound wave need to travel?**

Step 1: 

Hint:  We know that the speed of sound = 340 m/s. Since the object distance is given in cm, we either need to convert the distance in meters or speed of sound in centimeters. 



Step 2: 

Hint: Plug in the values to the speed equation and find time. 

Speed = distance/ time
distance = 2 * distance



**Q2.  If it takes 2 second for the sound wave to travel forward and bounce back, how far is the object from the ultrasonic sensor? Can the ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) we discussed in class measure this distance?**
